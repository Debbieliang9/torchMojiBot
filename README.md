# torchMojiBot

This repo contains the code and detailed instruction to reproduce the intelligent Slack bot I built in this blog post (TODO: add link). Powered by the [torchMoji](https://github.com/cw75/torchMoji) model, the bot automatically reacts to Slack messages with emoji.

Overall, there are 5 steps:
1. Set up the Slack bot by completing steps 1-4 [here](https://github.com/cw75/torchMojiBot/tree/master/slack).
2. Deploy the torchMoji model on [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) or [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/) (or both!). See [here](https://github.com/cw75/torchMojiBot/tree/master/sagemaker) for Sagemaker deployment and [here](https://github.com/cw75/torchMojiBot/tree/master/algorithmia) for Algorithmia deployment.
3. Deploy the AWS Lambda function that performs request authorization and routes traffic between Slack and the prediction service. Instruction [here](https://github.com/cw75/torchMojiBot/tree/master/lambda).
4. Set up the API gateway that routes traffic to the Lambda function and exposes a REST endpoint to Slack. Instruction [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/call-an-amazon-sagemaker-model-endpoint-using-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/) (Section: Create an API Gateway â€“ Integration request setup).
5. Finish setting up the Slack bot by completing step 5 [here](https://github.com/cw75/torchMojiBot/tree/master/slack).

After completing all the steps above, send a direct message "this is great!" to your bot in the Slack workspace. You should see the following.

When you are done having fun, remember to delete all the AWS resources you created!
